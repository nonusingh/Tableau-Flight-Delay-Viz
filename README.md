###Dataset: 
> The Data has been downloaded from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ for the last 5 years- 2013 to 2017. Then I performed a union on the individual year's data. Since the complete dataset is over 725 MB, I uploaded zipped csv files for individual years.
Summary: in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it
Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization
