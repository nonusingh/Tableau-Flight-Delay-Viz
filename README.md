# Flight Delay Visualization with Tableau
### Dataset: 
> The Data has been downloaded from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ for the last 5 years- 2013 to 2017. Then I performed a union on the individual year's data. Since the complete dataset is over 725 MB, I uploaded zipped csv files for individual years: 2013_1.csv.zip, 2014_1.csv.zip, 2015_1.csv.zip, 2016_1.csv.zip and 2017_1.csv.zip.

### Summary: 
> In this project, I have included visualizations to explore various flight delays over last five years. I created a story for delays elated to airline, weather, diverted flights, security and operational delays to draw some conclusions related to airports and airlines that have correlations to delayed or cancelled flights. Atlanta and Chicago Ohare airport and Delta, express jet airlines stood out.
The first version of the story is https://public.tableau.com/profile/nonu#!/vizhome/flights_initial/Story1?publish=yes

### Design: 
> I included 4 dashboards consisting of bar and line charts in the story. The first card has line charts to show delays and time relationship. The second card in the story shows bar charts connecting Origin airports, delay and time line. The third card explores the airline, and origin and destination airports relation and the fourth card shows a heat map of delays by origin and destination. All the charts on a card are interactive and filters in one affects the other.

### Feedback: 
> One of the feedback I received was to format the text in the story better and change colors on the second card so that origin airport bar chart and the delays by year bar chart do not have similar colors. I also received feedback to include cancelled flights in my heat map.
